# _**Super-heterodyne Receiver**_
> ## _Project Description_
   * The purpose of this project is to simulate the basic components of an analog communication system using
    MATLAB programming. Specifically, an AM modulator and a corresponding super-heterodyne receiver
    will be simulated using radio-station generated signals.

> ## __Run Program__
   * by running code, user required to choose which station he wants to hear & asked if he wants to do one of this tests (remove RF stage - 0.1K hz offset - 1k hz offset )

> ## _appreciation_
thanx to ( Omr Amr Mahmoud Hafez & Mohamed Khaled Mohamed Alahmady ) in first place for their code that helped me in first plae to understand the project.

their project :  https://github.com/0marAmr/Super-heterodyne-Receiver/tree/master

But this is extremely changed code new functions added, many concepts clarified, and issues fixed.
