# _**Super-heterodyne Receiver**_
> ## _Project Description_
   * The purpose of this project is to simulate the basic components of an analog communication system using
    MATLAB programming. Specifically, an AM modulator and a corresponding super-heterodyne receiver
    will be simulated using radio-station generated signals.

> ## __Run Program__
   * by running code, user required to choose which station he wants to hear & asked if he wants to do one of this tests (remove RF stage - 0.1K hz offset - 1k hz offset )
